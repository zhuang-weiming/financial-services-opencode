# LLMQuant Investor Lenses

This category routes investor-style reasoning overlays. The named workflows are analytical lenses, not claims of endorsement or replication. All external evidence must come from LLMQuant Data.

> **Integration note (persona grounding).** Each workflow is a *reasoning overlay* inspired by a named investor's documented style — it is **not** that investor's actual current view, endorsement, or a claim that "Buffett would buy X." Do not fabricate biographical quotes, personal holdings, or portfolio positions of the named investor. Every factual input (moat quality, margins, valuation, ownership, macro) must come from LLMQuant Data; the persona supplies only the *analytical frame* (the lens), never the evidence.

## Routing Rules

1. Identify the requested investor lens, ticker/asset, horizon, and decision type.
2. Select the closest workflow below.
3. Open only that workflow and any local resources explicitly referenced by that workflow.
4. Use LLMQuant Data for filings, prices, fundamentals, ownership, macro, and valuation evidence.
5. Separate evidence from interpretation and avoid unsupported persona claims.

## LLMQuant Data Contract

Prefer LLMQuant Data when available. The workflows may need these data capabilities:
- Retrieve filings, fundamentals, valuation inputs, market prices, 13F ownership, macro indicators, options context, credit context, and sentiment evidence.
- Support investor-lens analysis with dated evidence rather than persona-style assertions.
- Preserve the distinction between retrieved facts, user-provided assumptions, and the selected investor framework.

Fallback:
- If a lens needs unavailable data, name the missing input and continue only with retrieved or user-provided evidence.
- Do not invent quotes, holdings, valuation inputs, or biographical claims.
