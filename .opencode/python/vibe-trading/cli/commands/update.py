"""Self-update support: ``vibe-trading update``.

Checks PyPI for a newer ``vibe-trading-ai`` release than the currently
installed one and, when one exists, upgrades in place through ``pip`` using the
same interpreter that is running the CLI (``sys.executable -m pip``, never a
bare ``pip`` — the upgrade must target the interpreter that owns this CLI).

Scope decision (see ``.trellis/tasks/08-07-add-update/prd.md``): v1 handles the
PyPI-wheel install path only. Editable / git-checkout / Docker installs are
detected and answered with the right manual instruction instead of a pip
upgrade that would silently change the install type — ``pip install -U`` over
an ``pip install -e .`` install replaces the editable dev install with a
released wheel, which is a surprise nobody wants.

Design rules:
- Invoking ``vibe-trading update`` means "upgrade me": there is deliberately no
  confirmation prompt (user decision, 2026-08-07).
- Never downgrade: only upgrade when the latest PyPI version is strictly
  greater than the installed one (PEP 440).
- The upgrade runs in a subprocess; the current process has already imported
  the old code, so success is verified by re-reading installed metadata from a
  *fresh* subprocess.
- On any check failure the local install is left untouched.
- Docker is deliberately out of scope (user decision, 2026-08-07): inside a
  container the answer would be `git pull && docker compose up --build`, but
  detection is deferred.
