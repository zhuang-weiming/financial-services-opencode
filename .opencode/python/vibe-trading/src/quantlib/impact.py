"""Market-impact and slippage models for backtest execution.

Four models, ordered by how much of the order book they claim to know:

========================= ================================== =====================
Model                     Impact                             Use when
========================= ================================== =====================
:func:`fixed_slippage`    constant ``bps``                   order < 0.5% of ADV
:func:`linear_impact`     ``coeff * V / ADV``                order 0.5-5% of ADV
:func:`sqrt_impact`       ``eta * sigma * sqrt(V / ADV)``    order > 5% of ADV
:func:`delayed_execution` shifts a signal forward in time    always, for signal lag
========================= ================================== =====================

All three price models compute a non-negative impact and push the fill price
*against* the trader -- up when buying, down when selling.

The two size-aware models, :func:`linear_impact` and :func:`sqrt_impact`, are
additionally monotone non-decreasing in order size and return the untouched price
at zero size. :func:`fixed_slippage` takes no size at all: it charges its ``bps``
on every fill regardless of how small, which is the whole point of a fixed model
and the reason it is only appropriate below roughly 0.5% of ADV.

Every function here is scalar-only. Passing a numpy array or a pandas Series where
a ``float`` is documented raises rather than broadcasting.

These are backtest primitives. Nothing here places, routes or prices a live order.

Note on naming: the square-root model is frequently labelled "Almgren-Chriss" and
is indeed the impact term from that literature, but this module does **not**
implement Almgren-Chriss optimal execution -- there is no trading trajectory, no
permanent/temporary impact split and no risk-aversion parameter. Call it what it
is: a square-root impact function.
