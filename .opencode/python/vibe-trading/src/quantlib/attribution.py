"""Brinson-Fachler performance attribution with residual-free multi-period linking.

Single-period decomposition splits the active return (portfolio minus benchmark)
into three sector-level effects::

    Allocation_i  = (w_p,i - w_b,i) * (r_b,i - R_b)
    Selection_i   =  w_b,i          * (r_p,i - r_b,i)
    Interaction_i = (w_p,i - w_b,i) * (r_p,i - r_b,i)

The sum of all three over all sectors equals ``R_p - R_b`` *identically* -- there
is no residual and none is reported. The identity holds for any sector returns
whatsoever, provided only that the two weight vectors carry the same total; that
is the one precondition this module enforces (see :func:`brinson_fachler`).

Multi-period linking uses **Carino** logarithmic linking, for three reasons:

1. It is residual-free. Naively summing single-period arithmetic effects does not
   reproduce the compounded active return, because returns compound and effects
   are added; Carino's scaling factors absorb exactly that gap.
2. Its scaling factor for a period depends only on that period's total portfolio
   and benchmark return -- never on the effects being linked. Linking is therefore
   deterministic, order-independent, and cannot be steered by how the analyst
   chose to bucket sectors. Menchero's linking is likewise residual-free but
   distributes a correction term computed from the effects themselves, which adds
   machinery this module does not need.
3. It is what ``skills/performance-attribution/SKILL.md`` already prescribes, so
   the tested implementation and the documented method agree.

Carino defines a total factor ``k`` and a per-period factor ``k_t``::

    k   = (ln(1 + R_P) - ln(1 + R_B)) / (R_P - R_B)
    k_t = (ln(1 + R_p,t) - ln(1 + R_b,t)) / (R_p,t - R_b,t)

and scales every single-period effect by ``k_t / k``. Because each period's
effects sum to ``R_p,t - R_b,t``, the linked effects telescope through the
logarithms and sum to the compounded active return ``R_P - R_B`` exactly.

Only the standard library is imported here, so this module stays importable even
when an optional numerical dependency used elsewhere in ``quantlib`` is missing.
