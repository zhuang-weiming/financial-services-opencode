"""Purged and embargoed cross-validation for overlapping financial labels.

Plain K-fold assumes observations are independent. Financial labels are not: a
label formed at time ``t`` from the next 20 days of returns overlaps the labels
of the following 19 observations. Split such a sample naively and the training
set contains observations whose outcome window covers the test period. The model
is then evaluated on information it already saw, and the out-of-sample score is
not out of sample.

Two corrections, both from Lopez de Prado's treatment, and they fix different
leaks:

**Purging** removes from the training set any observation whose label interval
overlaps the test interval. This is the leak above, and it is *symmetric*: an
overlap matters whether the training observation starts before or after the test
window opens.

**Embargo** additionally removes training observations that begin shortly after
the test set ends. Purging alone does not catch this, because those labels do
not overlap -- they are merely serially correlated with the test period through
autocorrelated features and slow-moving state. The embargo is a blunt instrument
by design; its size is a judgement about how fast the series forgets.

THE OFF-BY-ONE IS THE WHOLE POINT
---------------------------------
The single most common implementation bug in this area is a boundary that leaks
exactly one bar: taking the test block as ``[start, end]`` and the training
block as everything outside ``[start, end)``, so the bar at ``end`` sits in both.
:func:`detect_boundary_leakage` exists to make that class of error assertable
rather than reviewable, and every splitter here is checked with it.

INTERVALS ARE CLOSED ON BOTH ENDS
---------------------------------
A label spanning ``[t0, t1]`` includes both endpoints. Two labels touching at a
single instant therefore *do* overlap. This is the conservative reading and it
is stated here because the alternative silently keeps one bar of contamination
at every boundary.
