"""Portfolio return when the client, not the manager, moves the money.

``backtest/metrics.py`` computes every figure from an equity curve and a single
scalar ``initial_cash``. That is the right model for a backtest, where the only
capital event is the opening deposit. It cannot express a real client account,
where money arrives and leaves on dates the manager did not choose. Feeding such
an account into a scalar-funded metric silently reports the *client's* deposits
as the *manager's* performance.

This module is the parallel path. It takes a valuation series plus an irregular
:class:`~src.entities.cashflow.CashFlowSeries` and reports the two answers that
actually exist, kept deliberately distinct:

``time_weighted_return``
    True daily-valuation TWR. Chain-links the return of each interval between
    valuations, so the size and the date of an external flow cancel out of the
    product entirely. This is the manager-skill number, and it is what GIPS
    composites report.

``modified_dietz_return``
    The classic day-weighted *approximation* to a money-weighted return. It
    needs only an opening value, a closing value, and dated flows -- no interim
    valuations -- which is why it survives in reporting stacks that cannot
    revalue daily. It is NOT a TWR, despite being widely mislabelled as one; it
    weights each flow by the fraction of the period it was invested and is
    therefore sensitive to flow timing.

``money_weighted_return``
    The internal rate of return (XIRR) of the client's own cash: opening value
    out, flows as they fell, closing value back. This is the client-experience
    number, and it moves with how much money was exposed to which stretch of
    the return path.

WHICH FLOWS ARE EXTERNAL
------------------------
Only movements **across the portfolio boundary** are external. A contribution,
capital call, subscription, transfer in, distribution, redemption, withdrawal,
or transfer out changes the capital base without the manager earning or losing
anything, so it must be removed before a return is struck
(:data:`DEFAULT_EXTERNAL_KINDS`).

A dividend, coupon, interest payment, fee, expense, purchase, or sale proceed is
**internal**: it is already inside the valuation series, and netting it out a
second time double-counts it (:data:`DEFAULT_INTERNAL_KINDS`). Valuation marks
(``nav``, ``residual_value``, ``valuation``) are not cash at all and are ignored.

A kind in neither table is an error, not a default. Silently ignoring an
unrecognised kind would understate the flow adjustment and produce a
plausible-looking wrong return; the caller must classify it explicitly through
``external_kinds=`` or ``internal_kinds=``.

SIGN CONVENTION
---------------
``CashFlow.amount`` is holder-perspective: a ``contribution`` is **negative**
because the cash leaves the client's pocket (see ``src.entities.cashflow``).
The portfolio sees the mirror image, so every external flow is negated exactly
once, here, at :func:`external_flows`. The library never asks a caller to flip
a sign, and :func:`money_weighted_return` consumes ``CashFlow.amount`` as-is
because the holder perspective *is* the IRR perspective.

Only the standard library is imported, matching the rest of ``quantlib``: an
optional numerical dependency missing elsewhere cannot break this module.
