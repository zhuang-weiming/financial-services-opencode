"""Risk measures: VaR/CVaR, drawdown, Monte Carlo simulation and EVT tail fitting.

SIGN CONVENTION -- read this before using anything here
------------------------------------------------------
**A loss is a positive number.** Every risk *magnitude* this module returns is
non-negative and grows as the risk gets worse:

* ``historical_var`` / ``parametric_var`` -- ``0.028`` means "a 2.8% loss".
* ``historical_cvar`` -- ``0.042`` means "a 4.2% average loss in the tail".
* ``max_drawdown_analysis()["max_drawdown"]`` -- ``0.325`` means "a 32.5%
  peak-to-trough decline". Note this is the opposite of the ``-0.325`` that a
  raw ``(equity / equity.cummax() - 1).min()`` produces; it is flipped here so
  that one rule covers the whole module.
* ``analyze_mc_results()["var"|"cvar"]`` -- same, positive losses.

Quantities that are *returns* rather than *losses* keep their natural sign and
are named ``*_return`` so the two can never be confused: ``mean_return``,
``worst_5pct_return`` and ``best_5pct_return`` are all signed returns, so a bad
outcome there is negative.

The invariant ``cvar >= var`` holds by construction for every pair of measures
computed from the same sample at the same confidence level. Note that this is
**not** ``cvar >= var >= 0``: the magnitudes are not clipped, so a sample whose
tail holds no actual loss reports a *negative* loss, i.e. a gain. Do not assert
non-negativity on a VaR; assert the ordering.

Quantile convention
-------------------
``historical_var`` uses a *non-interpolating lower order statistic*: with the
returns sorted ascending, it takes element ``ceil((1 - confidence) * n) - 1``
and negates it. No blending between neighbouring observations, so the result is
always an actually-observed return. ``historical_cvar`` averages every return at
or below that same order statistic (inclusive), which is the standard expected
shortfall and is what guarantees ``cvar >= var``.

    Each step applies ``(mu - 0.5 * sigma**2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z`` in

    Args:
        s0: Initial price, strictly positive.
        mu: Annualised drift of the arithmetic return.
        sigma: Annualised volatility, non-negative. Zero gives a deterministic
            path, which is useful as a test fixture.
        n_steps: Number of simulated steps, at least 1.
        n_paths: Number of paths, at least 1. Use 10,000 or more before reading
            anything off the tail.

    Extreme value theory says the exceedances over a high enough threshold
    converge to a GPD regardless of the parent distribution, which is what makes
    this usable where a normal fit is not. The location is pinned at zero
    because exceedances are non-negative by construction.

    ``tail_type`` is decided against ``shape_stderr``, not against exact zero. A
    maximum-likelihood shape is a float and is therefore never exactly ``0.0``,
    so a hard ``shape > 0`` test would label a genuinely exponential tail "fat"
    or "bounded" on the sign of estimation noise alone and would make the
    ``"exponential"`` label unreachable in practice.

        returns: Periodic (usually daily) return series.
        threshold_pct: Percentile defining the left tail, e.g. 5.0 keeps the
            worst 5% of returns. Must be in (0, 100).

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            threshold (float): The signed return at ``threshold_pct``; losses

                tail, ``< 0`` bounded tail.
            shape_stderr (float): Asymptotic standard error of ``shape_xi``,

            scale_sigma (float): GPD scale, in units of loss magnitude.
            tail_type (str): ``"fat"`` when ``shape_xi`` clears
