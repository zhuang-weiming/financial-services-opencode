"""Black-Scholes pricing, Greeks and implied-volatility inversion.

One implementation, called by both the backtest engine and the
``options-payoff`` skill. It merges two copies that had drifted apart: the
engine's (``backtest/engines/options_portfolio.py``, no dividend yield, no rho,
but with correct degenerate-input handling) and the skill's markdown listing
(dividend yield and rho, but it crashed on a non-positive spot/strike and
reported a zero delta for an expiring in-the-money option).

Conventions, fixed here so callers never have to guess:
  * ``T`` is in years, ``r`` and ``q`` are continuously compounded annual rates.
  * ``theta`` is per calendar day, ``vega`` and ``rho`` are per 1 percentage
    point of volatility / rate. ``delta`` and ``gamma`` are per 1.0 of spot.
  * Nothing is rounded. Rounding is a presentation decision and it destroys the
    vega precision the implied-volatility solver needs.

Degenerate inputs collapse the lognormal to a point mass. At expiry, or for a
non-positive spot/strike, the price is the immediate intrinsic value. With time
remaining but ``sigma <= 0``, the terminal spot is deterministic instead, so
the price is the discounted forward intrinsic value. They return that rather
than raising, because an expiring or zero-volatility leg is a normal state for a
backtest to walk through.

    """Fold an option-type string to ``"call"`` or ``"put"``.

    Public because callers that *store* an option type must fold it with the
    same rule the pricing functions use. Anything that keeps the raw string and
    later compares it with ``== "call"`` will price a leg typed ``"Call"`` as a
    call here and settle it as a put there.

    WHY THIS ACCEPTS ALIASES BUT STILL REFUSES THE UNKNOWN
    -----------------------------------------------------
    There are two different failure modes and they need opposite treatment.

    A config saying ``"C"``, ``"calls"`` or ``"认购"`` is *unambiguous* -- there
    is exactly one thing it can mean, and refusing it breaks a working setup for
    no safety gain. Those are folded (:data:`_CALL_ALIASES`, :data:`_PUT_ALIASES`).

    A config saying ``"cal"`` or ``"kall"`` is a typo, and the only safe answer
    is to stop. The behaviour this replaced defaulted an unrecognised type to
    put, so a mistyped call leg opened priced as a call and settled as a put --
    ten in-the-money contracts settling at zero. Guessing at a typo is how that
    happened, so an unknown string still raises.
