"""Fixed-income primitives: day count, bond math and yield-curve fitting.

This module is the executable form of the formulas that used to live as markdown
code blocks in ``src/skills/credit-analysis/SKILL.md``. Two things are deliberately
different from the markdown originals:

* **Day count is explicit.** The markdown priced everything in whole coupon
  periods, which silently assumes settlement lands exactly on a coupon date and
  that no accrued interest is owed. :func:`year_fraction` and
  :func:`accrued_interest` make that assumption visible and adjustable.
* **Compounding is explicit.** The markdown hard-coded discrete periodic
  compounding at ``freq``. That is still the default (``compounding="discrete"``),
  but continuous compounding is selectable.

All rates are decimals (``0.05`` means 5%), all maturities/horizons are in years,
and every duration/convexity figure is returned in years (or years squared),
never in coupon periods.
