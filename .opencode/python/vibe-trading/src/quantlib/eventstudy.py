"""Event study: abnormal returns around a dated corporate or macro event.

The question this answers is "did the market react to the event, beyond what it
would have done anyway", and the whole method is the *beyond* clause. A raw
return around an earnings date is not evidence of anything: the index moved too.
So a normal-return model is fitted on a window that ends before the event, and
what the model fails to explain during the event window is the abnormal return.

    AR_{i,t}  = R_{i,t} - E[R_{i,t}]          (abnormal return, one day)
    CAR_i     = sum over the event window      (one event's cumulative reaction)
    CAAR      = mean CAR across events         (the sample's average reaction)

THE ESTIMATION WINDOW MUST NOT TOUCH THE EVENT WINDOW
-----------------------------------------------------
If the event's own returns are inside the sample the model was fitted on, the
model has partly learned the event, the residual shrinks toward zero, and the
study under-reports its own finding. :data:`DEFAULT_ESTIMATION_GAP` puts rows
between the two windows, and an overlap is an error rather than a warning.

DAYS ARE ROWS, NOT CALENDAR DAYS
--------------------------------
Relative day ``-1`` means "the row before the event row" in the supplied return
frame. With daily bars that is the previous trading day, which is what event
studies mean by ``t-1``. A frame with gaps, or with a different bar size, shifts
that meaning; the caller owns the frame's spacing.

WHY THREE TEST STATISTICS
-------------------------
``t_statistic``
    Plain cross-sectional t-test on the CARs. Assumes the events are independent
    and equally variable. Fine for a quick read, wrong when a few volatile names
    dominate the sample.

``patell_z``
    Standardises each daily abnormal return by the standard error the estimation
    window implies for it, including the prediction-error term that accounts for
    the market return on that day sitting far from its estimation-window mean.
    Corrects for cross-sectional differences in volatility, but still assumes
    event-window variance equals estimation-window variance.

``bmp_z``
    Boehmer-Musumeci-Poulsen. Standardises like Patell, then takes the
    cross-sectional variance *of the standardised values*. This is the one that
    survives event-induced variance -- events routinely raise volatility, which
    inflates Patell's rejection rate. When the three disagree, BMP is the one to
    report.

None of the three fixes cross-sectional correlation from events that share a
date; clustered event dates need a calendar-time portfolio instead, and this
module says so via :attr:`EventStudyResult.shared_event_dates` rather than
silently reporting an over-confident z.
