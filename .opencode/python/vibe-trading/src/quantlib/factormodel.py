"""Cross-sectional style factor model: exposures, factor returns, drift.

This is the machinery behind "what is this portfolio actually betting on" --
whether a fund's outperformance came from a persistent tilt toward small, cheap,
high-momentum names, or from something the tilts do not explain.

IT IS NOT BARRA
---------------
Barra is a licensed commercial product from MSCI: their factor definitions,
their estimation universe, their covariance matrix. None of that is here and
none of it can be reproduced from public data. What is here is a
*Barra-style* cross-sectional model built from definitions stated in
:data:`STYLE_FACTOR_DEFINITIONS`, which are public-domain academic
constructions. Report the output as a style exposure from a named model. Never
present a number from this module as a Barra exposure -- they will not agree,
because they are not measuring the same thing.

THE STANDARDISATION IS THE MODEL
--------------------------------
An exposure is a cross-sectional z-score, so "value = 1.2" means *1.2 standard
deviations cheaper than the universe on this date*, not any absolute cheapness.
Three details make that number mean what it claims:

1. **Winsorise before standardising.** One delisting-bound name with a book/price
   of 40 will otherwise move the mean and inflate the standard deviation enough
   to compress every other name toward zero.
2. **Cap-weighted mean, equal-weighted standard deviation.** The mean is
   cap-weighted so that the *market portfolio* has zero exposure by construction
   -- which is what makes a portfolio's exposure readable as an active tilt away
   from the market rather than a level. The standard deviation is equal-weighted
   so a handful of megacaps cannot set the scale for the whole cross-section.
   This asymmetry is deliberate and is the convention commercial risk models use.
3. **A missing characteristic becomes exposure zero, i.e. the market average**,
   and the count of filled cells is reported. Dropping the name instead would
   silently change the universe between factors; imputing a nonzero value would
   invent a tilt.

FACTOR RETURNS COME FROM A CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSION
-----------------------------------------------------
For each date, regress that date's asset returns on the previous date's
exposures. The coefficients are the factor returns: what one unit of exposure
paid on that day. Weighting by square-root market cap is the standard choice --
it treats the regression as heteroskedastic in the way small caps actually are,
without letting megacaps dominate as full-cap weighting would.

The intercept is the market factor. It must be present: dropping it forces every
factor to absorb the market's return, and the "value factor" then reports the
market's direction.
