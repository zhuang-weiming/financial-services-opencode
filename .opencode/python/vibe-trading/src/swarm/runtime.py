    Workers persist artifacts as POSIX paths relative to the run directory
    (``artifacts/<agent>/<file>``; see ``worker._collect_artifacts``). A
    resumed run must not reference the old run's directory — the old run
    stays as a record and may be deleted later.

    The stored artifact list is on-disk state that may be stale or tampered,
    so every entry is validated before use:
    - Only paths under the ``artifacts/`` subtree are accepted, resolved to a
      real path on BOTH sides: ``artifacts/../run.json`` normalizes into the
      run root (control-file clobber) and a symlinked component such as
      ``artifacts/analyst -> tasks`` redirects the copy onto task files. The
      resolved source and resolved destination must each land inside BOTH the
      run directory and its ``artifacts/`` subtree — the run-root bound stops a
      symlinked ``artifacts/`` dir (e.g. ``artifacts -> /outside``) from
      redefining the safe boundary, the subtree bound stops redirection onto
      control/task files. Anything else (``run.json``, ``events.jsonl``,
      ``tasks/*.json``, absolute paths, ``..``, symlink redirection) is a
      control-file or path-traversal vector and is dropped — re-homing a kept
      artifact must never clobber the new run's own state files or write
      outside the run.
    - Missing files are dropped rather than re-homed.

        the failed/cancelled-subgraph re-execution #1157 asks for. Two
        exceptions, both enforced here:
        - A completed task is NOT kept when its definition changed since the
          original run — the task's own defining fields (agent, prompt
          template, DAG wiring) or the agent spec that executes it (role,
          system prompt, tools, skills, model, retries, timeout) — because a
          kept result must still mean the same thing.
        - A completed task is NOT kept when any of its transitive upstreams
          re-executes, because its kept summary was produced from the upstream's
          old output and would be stale relative to the fresh upstream output
          flowing into it (and unchanged dependents cascade the same way).
        Kept tasks are re-marked ``completed`` with their original
        summary/artifacts (artifacts re-homed into this run's directory so the
        new run is self-contained), kept ids are resolved out of downstream
        ``blocked_by`` edges, and their summaries are seeded into
        ``task_summaries`` so ``input_from`` context flows to re-executed
        dependents. Tasks with no counterpart in the original run (added to the
        preset since) run fresh.

        Degradation: a wholly missing or unreadable prior task store falls back
        to a fully fresh run (logged, never fatal). Individual tasks absent
        from an otherwise-readable store (e.g. preset evolution that removed
        them) simply have no kept counterpart and re-execute — that is not a
        store failure, so it does not trigger the fresh-run fallback.
