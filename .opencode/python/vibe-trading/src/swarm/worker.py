    Steps:
      1. Build filtered ToolRegistry from agent_spec.tools
      2. Build system prompt with role + upstream summaries + filtered skills
      3. Resolve task.prompt_template with user_vars
      4. Run ReAct loop (for iteration in range(max_iterations))
      5. Write summary to artifacts/{agent_id}/summary.md
      6. Return WorkerResult

    Args:
        agent_spec: Agent role specification with tools/skills/model config.
        task: The task to execute, including prompt template.
        upstream_summaries: Summaries from upstream tasks keyed by input_from keys.
        user_vars: User-provided variables for template rendering.
        run_dir: Path to .swarm/runs/{run_id}/ directory.
        llm: Pre-built ChatLLM; ownership stays with the caller
            (:func:`run_worker` closes it in a ``finally``).
        event_callback: Optional callback for swarm events.
        include_shell_tools: Whether this worker may register shell tools.
        grounding_block: Optional pre-rendered "Ground Truth" markdown that
            anchors the worker on real recent prices for symbols mentioned in
            ``user_vars``. Forwarded verbatim to :func:`build_worker_prompt`.
        agent_config: Optional resolved agent config carrying remote MCP
            server definitions. Threaded from :class:`SwarmRuntime` and
            consumed by :func:`build_swarm_registry` to merge remote MCP
            tools with the local-tool pool before applying the agent's
            whitelist. ``None`` preserves the prior local-only behavior.
        cancel_event: Optional cancellation signal from
            :meth:`SwarmRuntime.cancel_run`. Checked at the top of each
            ReAct iteration and passed into the LLM stream as
            ``should_cancel``, mirroring ``AgentLoop``'s cooperative
            cancellation contract: an in-flight LLM stream stops promptly
            and that turn's tool calls are skipped; a tool call already
            executing is not interrupted.
