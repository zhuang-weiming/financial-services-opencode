"""Read-only prediction-market (event-contract) data tool.

Prediction markets quote binary event contracts: each outcome is a token that
settles at $1 if the event happens and $0 otherwise. The live share price is
therefore the market's *implied probability* of that outcome, which makes these
venues an alternative data feed for event-driven research — rate decisions,
elections, geopolitical events, earnings-adjacent questions.

Data comes from two public, no-auth Polymarket services (both verified
reachable; every field name below was read off a live response, not inferred):

* Gamma (``https://gamma-api.polymarket.com``) — catalogue and current quotes.
  - ``GET /public-search?q=&limit_per_type=&events_status=`` returns
    ``{"events": [...], "pagination": {"hasMore", "totalResults"}}``.
    ``events_status=active`` keeps only ``closed == false`` events and
    ``events_status=resolved`` only ``closed == true``; any other value is
    effectively unfiltered.
  - ``GET /events/<numeric id>`` returns one event object; a miss is HTTP 404
    with ``{"type": "not found error", "error": "id not found"}``.
  - ``GET /events?slug=<exact slug>`` returns a list (empty on a partial slug —
    the match is exact, not prefix).
  - ``GET /markets/<numeric id>`` returns one market object.
  Event objects carry ``id, ticker, slug, title, description, startDate,
  endDate, closedTime, active, closed, archived, liquidity, volume,
  volume24hr, markets``.
  Market objects carry ``id, question, conditionId, slug, endDate, closed,
  active, archived, acceptingOrders, outcomes, outcomePrices, clobTokenIds,
  bestBid, bestAsk, lastTradePrice, spread, oneDayPriceChange, volumeNum,
  liquidityNum, closedTime, resolvedBy, umaResolutionStatus,
  umaResolutionStatuses``.

* CLOB (``https://clob.polymarket.com``) — order book and price history.
  - ``GET /book?token_id=<clob token id>`` returns ``{bids, asks, asset_id,
    market, hash, last_trade_price, min_order_size, neg_risk, tick_size,
    timestamp}``. ``bids``/``asks`` are ``{"price", "size"}`` pairs with string
    values; bids arrive ascending and asks descending, so the *last* element of
    each is the top of book.
  - ``GET /markets/<conditionId>`` returns ``tokens: [{token_id, outcome,
    price, winner}]``. ``winner`` is the venue's own settlement flag and is the
    strongest resolution evidence either API exposes.
  - ``GET /prices-history?market=<clob token id>&interval=&fidelity=`` returns
    ``{"history": [{"t": epoch_seconds, "p": price}]}``.

Gotchas this module compensates for:

* Gamma serializes ``outcomes``, ``outcomePrices`` and ``clobTokenIds`` as JSON
  *strings*, not arrays. They must be decoded before use.
* The history ``interval`` grammar is ``1h, 6h, 1d, 1w, 1m, max`` — and ``1m``
  means one **month**, not one minute (an ``interval=1m`` probe returned 31
  daily points spanning a month). ``fidelity`` is the bar width in *minutes*.
  The server rejects unknown intervals with an explicit "Known values" error.
* ``prices-history`` is keyed by a CLOB token id (one series per outcome), not
  by the market id, so a market id has to be resolved to a token first.

Closing and resolving are two different upstream events, and this module keeps
them in two different fields. Every record therefore carries a lifecycle
``status`` *and* a separate ``resolution`` block, and the two never substitute
for each other:

* ``status`` — ``open`` (trading), ``closed`` (trading ended), ``resolved``
  (trading ended *and* a resolution record exists), ``inactive``
  (``active == false``) or ``archived`` (delisted from the catalogue;
  ``archived`` is reported ahead of the others because it describes the
  catalogue entry rather than the contract).
* ``resolution.state`` — ``unresolved`` (still trading), ``pending`` (trading
  closed but nothing in the payload states the outcome) or ``resolved``.
  ``pending`` means *unknown to this tool*, not *no winner*.

Evidence used for ``resolved``, strongest first, with the winner named only
when the payload actually identifies one:

1. CLOB ``tokens[].winner`` — exactly one token flagged. Direct venue
   statement; available on the ``0x`` condition-id path.
2. Gamma ``umaResolutionStatus`` in ``{"resolved", "settled"}``. Observed
   values of that field across a live sample are ``null`` (702/800),
   ``"resolved"`` (93), ``"settled"`` (4) and ``"proposed"`` (1); ``proposed``
   means an answer was submitted to the oracle but is not final, so it maps to
   ``pending``. The sibling ``umaResolutionStatuses`` (plural) is a JSON string
   that was ``"[]"`` on 799 of those 800 markets and is not used.

Things deliberately *not* treated as settlement evidence:

* ``closed == true`` on its own. It means trading ended. 400 sampled closed
  markets included pre-oracle 2020 markets whose ``outcomePrices`` are
  ``["0", "0"]`` — closed for five years, with no outcome recorded anywhere.
* An outcome price at or above ``_SETTLED_PRICE_FLOOR``. 115 of 400 sampled
  *open* markets had a price >= 0.99, so a pinned price is a probability, not a
  settlement. On a closed market it is reported as ``implied_winning_outcome``
  and explicitly labelled an inference; it never promotes ``state``.
* ``resolvedBy``. It is the resolver contract address and is populated on open
  markets too (market 2774056, ``closed == false``, carries one).
* A settled market keeps ``active == true``, so ``active`` says nothing about
  settlement either.

The two directions this costs and pays: two markets in a 300-market sample of
recently closed markets carry ``umaResolutionStatus == "resolved"`` with prices
``["0.5", "0.5"]`` (a void/tie resolution). They are reported ``resolved`` with
``winning_outcome`` null, where a price-only rule would have called them
unresolved. Conversely a pre-oracle closed market with a price pinned at
0.9999996 is reported ``pending`` with an ``implied_winning_outcome``, where
the old rule asserted it as settled.

This tool is strictly read-only: it issues GET requests against public data
endpoints only and has no order, position or account surface of any kind.
