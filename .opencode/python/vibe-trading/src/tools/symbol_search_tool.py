"""Read-only symbol-search tool: resolve a name/ticker to symbols + market.

Backed by the selected Binance connector for exact crypto pairs plus three
frozen, IP-throttled public-API clients so the agent never hits a provider
un-throttled and never re-implements transport plumbing:

* The active Binance profile resolves exact spot-pair spellings against its
  exchange market catalog. It does not guess asset names from prose.

* :mod:`backtest.loaders.eastmoney_client` — Eastmoney's free suggest endpoint
  matches Chinese/English names and tickers across A-shares (.SH/.SZ/.BJ),
  Hong Kong (.HK) and U.S. (.US) listings, each carrying a fully-qualified
  ``secid`` already in ``<market>.<code>`` form.
* :mod:`backtest.loaders.yahoo_client` — Yahoo's v1 search endpoint matches
  global tickers/company names (US, HK, Canada, crypto, indices, FX, ...).
* :mod:`backtest.loaders.sec_edgar_client` — the SEC company-tickers table
  enriches a resolved U.S. equity ticker with its zero-padded CIK.

The tool fans out across these sources, normalizes every hit into one compact
candidate row in the project's symbol convention, de-duplicates by symbol, and
caps the payload. A single failing source never aborts the others; its error is
recorded under ``sources`` and the surviving candidates still return.

# The pattern matches a LEADING Canadian ticker, optionally followed by free

# Canadian suffixes, so a leading one is unambiguous and Eastmoney can never
# serve it. Bare names with no suffix (e.g. "BTO", "B2Gold BTO") carry no

#     stablecoin-gold tokens XAUT/PAXG that ARE crypto). Without this guard a
