"""Run-scoped identity and numeric evidence gates for the main agent loop.

The language model remains responsible for research and explanation, but three
facts are structural rather than advisory:

* a market-data consumer may only use an identity that was locked before the
  current assistant tool-call batch started;
* a final price claim may not contradict the full, untruncated tool result; and
* a figure may not be attached to an instrument that no tool call in this run
  ever passed in or returned.

Those are the mechanically decidable parts of the agent's output principles.
The rest of that contract — "state the as-of", "analysis, not advice", "refuse
out loud" — stays in the system prompt on purpose: see ``_validate_price_claims``
and the module tests for why a regex gate on them rejects correct answers.

This module deliberately contains no provider or tool-registry dependencies so
its state machine and final-answer checks remain deterministic and testable.
