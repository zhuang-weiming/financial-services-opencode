"""Built-in MetaTrader 5 connector profiles.

"Paper" is the broker's DEMO MT5 account (e.g. an Exness demo) — MT5 has no
separate sandbox API. Unlike key-scoped connectors the discriminator is hard:
every session re-reads ``account_info().trade_mode`` from the terminal and
rejects a paper profile attached to a real-money account (and vice versa;
contest accounts are rejected everywhere). The order-placing profiles add
``orders.place``; the live one is gated behind a mandate + kill switch.
Requires Windows, the ``MetaTrader5`` extra, and a running logged-in terminal.
