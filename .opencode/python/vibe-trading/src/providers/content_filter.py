"""Content-filter resilience helpers shared by AgentLoop and swarm worker.

When an LLM provider blocks a response via content moderation
(``finish_reason == "content_filter"``), the caller skips that iteration
and continues instead of breaking on empty/garbage content.  These
helpers centralise threshold parsing, the warning-string format, and the
consecutive-skip circuit breaker so both the agent loop and the swarm
worker stay in sync.
