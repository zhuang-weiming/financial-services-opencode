"""Registration guard for the strategy-discovery tool set.

This module is the single source of truth for the Strategy Discovery routing
text injected into the agent's Task-Routing prompt section, and for checking
whether the discovery tools (three read-only plus the refresh write tool)
are actually registered. It is fail-safe by design: when any tool is missing
(or the registry object does not quack as expected) the routing block is
omitted rather than advertising tools the agent cannot call — the exact
failure mode of the rejected #896. The routing block names all four tools,
so the guard covers all four: advertising ``refresh_strategy_evidence``
while only the three reads register would reintroduce the phantom-tool
failure the guard exists to prevent.

The module must stay dependency-free: context builders import it eagerly, so
it may never pull in the facade, the store, or any heavy module.
