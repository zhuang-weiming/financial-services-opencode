"""Read-only parsing of backtest run artifacts for the evidence harness.

Pure CSV I/O over ``run_dir/artifacts`` — no network, no invention. The
harness reads only what a reproducible run actually recorded.

Real engine schema (``backtest/engines/base.py::_write_artifacts``, the
writer every reproducible run goes through):

* ``trades.csv`` — columns ``timestamp, code, side, price, qty, reason,
  pnl, holding_days, return_pct`` with TWO rows per round trip: an entry
  row (``reason="signal"``, ``pnl=0.0``, ``holding_days=0``) followed by
  the exit row carrying the realized ``pnl``.
* ``equity.csv`` — date column ``timestamp`` (the engine's index name)
  plus ``ret, equity, drawdown, benchmark_equity, active_ret``.

Entry/exit convention. The engine writes no dedicated marker column, and
``reason`` is not one either — exits can also carry ``reason="signal"``
(the base engine closes positions on signal). This reader therefore
mirrors the repo's own artifact-reload convention in
``backtest/validation.py``: a row is a closed-trade (exit) row iff its
``pnl`` parses to a nonzero finite value, while ``pnl == 0.0`` rows are
entry rows. Files with no zero-pnl rows at all are treated as legacy
one-row-per-trade artifacts where every dated row is a meaningful closed
trade. Documented limitation (shared with ``validation.py``): an
exact-break-even exit (``pnl == 0.0``) is indistinguishable from an entry
row and is not counted as a round trip.

Legacy artifacts keep parsing through column aliases (``date`` for
``timestamp``, ``benchmark`` for ``benchmark_equity``). Unusable files —
missing date/equity columns, decode errors, OS errors, malformed CSV —
return ``None`` with a logged warning instead of raising; malformed rows
are skipped rather than guessed at.
