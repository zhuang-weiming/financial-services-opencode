"""Evidence harness: compute per-regime evidence from real backtest artifacts.

Builds on the artifact readers in :mod:`run_artifacts`; this module owns the
regime labeling and the per-regime metrics. Conventions:

* Trade counting — engine ``trades.csv`` artifacts hold TWO rows per round
  trip (entry row ``pnl=0.0`` + exit row with realized pnl); only exit rows
  are counted, so a round trip contributes exactly one trade. Legacy
  one-row-per-trade artifacts are detected via the marker column and keep
  counting every row (see :func:`run_artifacts.read_trade_activity`).
* Regime labeling — each bar is labeled by the rolling cumulative benchmark
  return over the trailing ``benchmark_window`` bars ending at that bar
  (``<= bear_threshold`` → bear_market, ``>= bull_threshold`` → bull_market,
  else structural). Bars without enough history or a usable benchmark value
  are labeled ``structural`` and documented as warm-up, never guessed.
* Per-regime metrics use only regime bars: compounded strategy/benchmark
  returns are products of per-bar returns across the union of the regime's
  bars; Sharpe is mean/std of per-bar strategy returns inside regime bars,
  annualized with ``sqrt(252)`` (bars assumed daily); max drawdown tracks
  the strategy equity peak across regime bars.
* Multi-position null — the sizing-corrected breakeven identity is exact
  only for strategies holding one position at a time. For runs that held
  several positions at once the aggregate form is structurally invalid
  (no closed form; measured error 1.1x-6.5x — issue #969, sergio12S), so
  those rows carry ``breakeven_fee_bps = None`` instead of a wrong number,
  plus a stable ``multi-position-breakeven:`` warning. Runs whose artifacts
  make concurrency undetectable are treated the same way (fail-closed).

Missing inputs return ``[]`` with a warning: honest empty beats fabricated
rows every time.

    """Atomically replace the store contents from a sequence of run specs.

    Each mapping needs ``strategy_id`` and ``run_dir``; an optional
    ``position_size`` overrides exposure-derived sizing. Runs that yield no
    computable evidence are reported in ``skipped`` with a reason — nothing
    is invented for them. Runs refused by the D4 hard gates are skipped with
    the exact ``hard-gate:<token>`` reason (the gates run here BEFORE
    computation so the envelope can record the token;
    :func:`compute_evidence_for_run` re-checks them internally for direct
    library callers — both paths share :func:`check_run_hard_gates`).

    ATOMIC (plan D5): ALL rows are computed first, then written with one
    ``store.replace_rows(all_rows)`` call (DELETE-all + INSERT-all in a
    single transaction). A mid-compute failure therefore never leaves the
    store half-populated — the previous contents survive intact. An empty
    ``all_rows`` still replaces (clears) the store: a rebuild is a full
    statement of the evidence, not a patch.

    Eligibility vs sufficiency (plan D4): the hard gates certify run
    ELIGIBILITY from metrics.csv ``trade_count``; the per-regime rows below
    are gated by EVIDENCE SUFFICIENCY (the harness's closed-round-trip
    count). The two counts can disagree (entries without exits); that is
    intentional and documented.
