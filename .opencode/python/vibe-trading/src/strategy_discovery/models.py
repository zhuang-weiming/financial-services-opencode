"""Pure data models and threshold logic for strategy-discovery evidence.

This module is intentionally I/O-free so it can be imported cheaply and unit
tested without a database or the network. It defines the two frozen dataclasses
(``EvidenceRow``, ``StrategySummary``) that flow between the evidence store,
the evidence harness, and the facade, plus the small set of pure helper
functions used to classify evidence quality, compute the sizing-corrected
breakeven fee, and derive the month-granularity date coverage span.

The numeric thresholds here are the single source of truth for what counts as
``adequate`` / ``marginal`` / ``insufficient`` evidence. The facade and the
harness import these constants rather than re-deriving them, so the #969
adversarial borders (buffered "borderline" bands) stay consistent everywhere.
